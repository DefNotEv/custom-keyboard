What's up reviewers! My physics exam is in 5 days and I really really really don't want to study so I'm gonna do all of this in like two days. I know I'm not suppposed to be rushing this and I'm supposed to have a "smaller, more consistent" journal for a "more realistic story" so I'm sorry in advance!

Anyway my goals for today:
- Figure out what parts I want to use for my keyboard
- Finish designing the PCB
- Hopefully finish designing the case
- Actually remember to journal

it has come to my attention i have severely overestimated myself and we're gonna be compeltely switching up!!!! 

well. the tutorial i was following has two parts and is supposed to have a part three. but it hasn't come out. so like. yeah. we are going to a basic 60% keyboard. much easier to wire. much easier for my mental health. i have the whole month to try and build a more complicated keyboard. so we're going to stick to the basics first. pro micro to make my life easier. i pinky swear i will make a tkl by the end of this though.

20 hours of my life bruh.

anyway yeah. how's that for documenting everything i do ðŸ˜­
