What's up reviewers! My physics exam is in 5 days and I really really really don't want to study so I'm gonna do all of this in like two days. I know I'm not suppposed to be rushing this and I'm supposed to have a "smaller, more consistent" journal for a "more realistic story" so I'm sorry in advance!

Anyway my goals for today:
- Figure out what parts I want to use for my keyboard
- Finish designing the PCB
- Hopefully finish designing the case
- Actually remember to journal
